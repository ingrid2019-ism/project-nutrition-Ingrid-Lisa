# Project Nutrition

This was a pairprogramming assignment and the task was to fetch API data, use a barcode scanner and render information about the scanned food item. 

## The problem
We missed one detail in conditional rendering that cost us a lot of time. Im not proud over the initial styling but we did manage to meet all the requirements in a short time and we did learn alot abot redux and stores.
